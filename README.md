# Computor v1

In Fortran90 for the best experience

## Why in Fortran ?
- Like the boomers said, "It was better before"
- Like a wise viking said, "A true warrior doesn't need a sword"
- Like a depressed piscineux said, "Sh-t, I can't beat split whitespaces"

Obviously, no split for parsing, more pleasure :)

## Features
- Only one file with 379 of pure fortran
- Extreme code bloating
- Made in 1 hour
- Handles natural form and parsing errors
- Not in python
- Not in C
- Makefile from LIDL
- No leaks (it's a bonus of course)
- Can parse samurai haxxor equations like `.15X^2-X+.=`
- Unreadable enough to let you trick your correctors
- Reduce the amount of messages you get on Linkedin
- If you push it on the vogsphere I will give you a -42 in person :)

## Issues
- Don't display degrees over 9 (Obviously, you want to resolve 2nd degree equations, no need of X^50)
- `2X^2+X^15=` reads the equations like `2 * X^2 + X^1 + 5 = 0`
