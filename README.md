# Computor v1

In Fortran90 for the best experience

## Upfront note (Important)
This project was (obviously) meant to be a joke, as some of my other 42 projects.
The code here was purposely made to look dirty and to feel unreadable, despite the flexibility and the stability of the program itself.
Being able to do 42 projects using incongruous languages or odd ergonomy and getting full score in them by fitting all the mandatory subject points is something pretty challenging and something I personally especially enjoy.

## Why in Fortran ?
- Like the boomers said, "It was better before"
- Like a wise viking said, "A true warrior doesn't need a sword"
- Like a depressed piscineux said, "Sh-t, I can't beat split whitespaces"

Obviously, no split for parsing, more pleasure :)

## Features
- Only one file with 398 lines of pure fortran
- Extreme code bloating
- Made in 1 hour
- Handles natural form and parsing errors
- Not in python
- Not in C
- Makefile from LIDL
- No leaks (it's a bonus of course)
- Can parse samurai haxxor equations like `.15X^2-X+.=`
- Unreadable enough to let you trick your correctors
- Reduce the amount of messages you get on Linkedin
- If you push it on the vogsphere I will give you a -42 in person :)

## Issues
- Triggers a parsing error if degrees over 9 (Obviously, you want to resolve 2nd degree equations, no need of X^50)
- Treats `X 5 = 2` as `X + 5 = 2`
